Kernel Assault Cube Project
Overview
Kernel Assault Cube Project is an advanced Windows kernel-mode driver designed to interact with the open-source FPS game Assault Cube. This project demonstrates sophisticated memory manipulation techniques at the kernel level to achieve enhanced game functionality, providing both educational insights into Windows driver development and practical applications of system-level programming.
Key Features
Kernel-Mode Operations

Ring 0 Execution: Operates at the highest privilege level (Ring 0) within the Windows architecture, allowing for direct hardware access and complete system control
Direct Memory Manipulation: Bypasses user-mode restrictions to read and write game memory with maximum efficiency
Process Protection Circumvention: Demonstrates techniques to interact with protected processes that conventional user-mode approaches cannot access

Game Interaction Capabilities

Entity Detection: Advanced scanning algorithms that identify and track player entities within the game environment
Statistical Modification: Sophisticated methods to alter game-related values such as ammunition, health, and armor
Position Manipulation: Precise control over entity coordinates and orientation within the game world
View Angle Calculations: Implementation of mathematical algorithms for accurate view angle determination

System Architecture

IOCTL Communication: Implements a robust communication protocol between user-mode applications and the kernel driver
Memory Management: Efficient handling of physical and virtual memory mappings for optimal performance
Error Handling: Comprehensive system to manage and recover from exceptional conditions
Device Object Management: Proper creation and maintenance of device objects for system integration

Technical Implementation
Driver Components

Entry Point Management: Sophisticated handler for driver initialization and teardown processes
Device Creation: Dynamic establishment of device objects for communication with user-mode applications
