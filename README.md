# ‚ú® Key Features

## Kernel-Mode Operations

- **Ring 0 Execution:** Operates at the highest privilege level within the Windows architecture, allowing direct hardware access and full system control.
- **Direct Memory Manipulation:** Bypasses user-mode restrictions to efficiently read and write game memory.
- **Process Protection Circumvention:** Demonstrates techniques to interact with protected processes that conventional user-mode approaches cannot access.

## Game Interaction Capabilities

- **Entity Detection:** Advanced scanning algorithms to identify and track player entities in the game world.
- **Statistical Modification:** Sophisticated methods to alter in-game values like ammunition, health, and armor.
- **Position Manipulation:** Precise control over entity coordinates and orientation.
- **View Angle Calculations:** Mathematical algorithms for accurate and reliable view angle computation.
