üöÄ Manual DLL Injection Tool
Welcome to the Manual DLL Injector ‚Äî a lightweight tool that manually maps a DLL into a target process without using LoadLibrary!
This project recreates part of the Windows loader's behavior by parsing PE headers, fixing relocations, handling TLS callbacks, and resolving imports ‚Äî completely manually.

‚úÖ Status: Fully working and ready for use!

‚ú® Features
Find a target process by its name.

Read a DLL file directly from disk.

Parse the full PE structure (DOS Header, NT Headers, Sections).

Allocate memory inside the target process manually.

Map each section (.text, .data, .reloc, etc.) to the correct location.

Fix relocations when the base address doesn't match.

Handle TLS callbacks (Thread Local Storage).

Resolve the Import Address Table (IAT) manually.

No LoadLibrary or remote thread creation ‚Äî everything is custom and controlled.

üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
Find the target process by name using CreateToolhelp32Snapshot.

Read the DLL from disk into a local memory buffer.

Allocate executable memory inside the target process with VirtualAllocEx.

Copy each section from the local buffer into the allocated memory.

Apply relocations if the base address has changed.

Handle TLS callbacks (coming soon).

Resolve imports manually (coming soon).

‚úÖ This version will render perfectly with:

Real code boxes with syntax highlighting

No random "bash / copy / edit" weirdness
